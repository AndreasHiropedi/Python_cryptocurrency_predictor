# Python cryptocurrency predictor

A web dashboard using Python's in-built libraries, more specifically Streamlit, with up-to-date crypto data scraped from Yahoo finance. The dashboard displays several tables and graphs, including trends in actual data and future predictions for several different currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and DogeCoin to name a few.

Note: due to the high volume of data, we set the starting point to 01/01/2019 (Jaunary 1st 2019), and we only consider data from this point up until the current date. 

DISCLAIMER: This tool is intended for fun and educational purposes only and should therefore not be treated as financial advice for trading cryptocurrencies.
